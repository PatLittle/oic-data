# First, stream JSON files to mlr, converting them from JSON to CSV; use xargs because the file list exhausts argument limits (~5k per batch).
# Then, remove extra header rows caused by calling mlr multiple times through xargs.
# Then, remove the processing file, and save the output.
#
# NB, differences in format between this and output of `oic-analysis` (which runs against the HTML):
# - pcNumber and htmlHash column names remain in camelCase
# - attachments is a stringified JSON array
# - year and number are not extracted from pcNumber
# - department is not processed after extraction, department_raw is not created
# - text column (html_text2 of the html column) is not created
