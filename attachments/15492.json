Relating to Maher Arar</em> of September 18, 2006 recommends that the cases of Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad&nbsp;Abou‑Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin should be reviewed and that the review should be done through an independent and credible process that is able to address the integrated nature of the underlying investigations and inspires public confidence in the outcome;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style=\"text-indent:1.0in\">Whereas that report states that there are more appropriate ways than a full‑scale public inquiry to investigate and report on cases where national security confidentiality must play a prominent role;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style=\"text-indent:.5in\">And whereas the Government of Canada, the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs have committed to full cooperation with the review process;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style=\"text-indent:.5in\">Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, hereby directs that a Commission do issue under Part I of the <em>Inquiries Act</em> and under the Great Seal of Canada appointing the Honourable Frank Iacobucci as Commissioner to conduct an internal inquiry into the actions of Canadian officials in relation to Abdullah&nbsp;Almalki, Ahmad Abou‑Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin (the “Inquiry”), which Commission shall</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style=\"margin-left:.2in\">(<em>a</em>) direct the Commissioner to conduct the Inquiry in order to determine the following:</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style=\"margin-left:.2in\">(i) whether the detention of Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad Abou‑Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin in Syria or Egypt resulted, directly or indirectly, from actions of Canadian officials, particularly in relation to the sharing of information with foreign countries and, if so, whether those actions were deficient in the circumstances,</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align:right\">...2</p>  </div>  <br clear=\"all\" style=\"page-break-before:always\">   <div>  <p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">- 2 - </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style=\"margin-left:.2in\">(ii) whether there were deficiencies in the actions taken by Canadian officials to provide consular services to Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad&nbsp;Abou‑Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin while they were detained in Syria or Egypt, and</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p style=\"margin-left:.2in\">(iii) whether any mistreatment of Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad&nbsp;Abou‑Elmaati and Muayyed Nureddin in Syria or Egypt resulted, directly or indirectly, from actions of Canadian officials, particularly in relation to the sharing of information with foreign countries and, if so, whether those actions were deficient in the circumstances;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>(<em>b)</em> direct the Commissioner to conduct the Inquiry as he considers appropriate with respect to accepting as conclusive, or giving weight to, the findings of other examinations that may have been conducted into the actions of

subject‑matter of the Inquiry an opportunity for appropriate participation in it;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align:right\">...3</p>  </div>  <br
