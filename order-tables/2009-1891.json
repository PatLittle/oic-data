The regulations include requiring the reporting of operating and capital expenditures, including the cost of well operation, in operators' Annual Production Reports.  This ensures that the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board receives the information necessary for regulatory oversight to ensure appropriate production and management of the resource in order to prevent waste, as well as to verify whether the operator is in compliance with section 65 of the provincial regulations.</td></tr><tr><td>Registration</td><td colspan=\"5\" id=\"registration\"><strong>Registration: </strong>SOR/ 2009-0316  <strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2009-12-09</td></tr><tr><td>Attachments</td><td colspan=\"5\"><a href=\"attachment.php?attach=21779&amp;lang=en\">Attachment</a></td></tr></tbody></table>",
