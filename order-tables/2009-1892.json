This ensures that the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board  receives the information necessary for regulatory oversight to ensure appropriate production and management of the resource in order to prevent waste, as well as to verify whether the operator is in compliance with section 65 of the provincial regulations.</td></tr><tr><td>Registration</td><td colspan=\"5\" id=\"registration\"><strong>Registration: </strong>SOR/ 2009-0317  <strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2009-12-09</td></tr><tr><td>Attachments</td><td colspan=\"5\"><a href=\"attachment.php?attach=21780&amp;lang=en\">Attachment</a></td></tr></tbody></table>",
