This will improve the ability of law enforcement agencies to enforce the Copyright Act by permitting the seizure, restraint and confiscation of proceeds derived from the commission of copyright-related offences and will complement existing enforcement strategies to combat organized crime and copyright piracy.</td></tr><tr><td>Registration</td><td colspan=\"5\" id=\"registration\"><strong>Registration: </strong>SOR/ 2010-0074  <strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2010-04-14</td></tr><tr><td>Attachments</td><td colspan=\"5\"><a href=\"attachment.php?attach=22370&amp;lang=en\">Attachment</a></td></tr></tbody></table>",
