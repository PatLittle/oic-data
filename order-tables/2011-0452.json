The regulations take into account the exceptional circumstances under which this group of drugs will be used and the challenges manufacturers face when designing clinical studies for these drugs, allowing the manufacturer to use results of animal studies in conjunction with results from limited human safety studies, in support of their drug submission. The goal is to provide Canadians with access to extraordinary use drugs which have undergone a pre-market review for safety and quality and will be followed in the post-market period for safety and efficacy.</td></tr><tr><td>Registration</td><td colspan=\"5\" id=\"registration\"><strong>Registration: </strong>SOR/ 2011-0088  <strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2011-04-13</td></tr><tr><td>Attachments</td><td colspan=\"5\"><a href=\"attachment.php?attach=24120&amp;lang=en\">Attachment</a></td></tr></tbody></table>",
