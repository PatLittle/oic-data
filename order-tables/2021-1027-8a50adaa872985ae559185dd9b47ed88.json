Canadian airports with an annual passenger threshold of at least 325,000 for two consecutive years will be subject to the amendments. In the event that it is not possible to increase the size of the existing safety area outside the runway, the amendments offer other options that provide an equivalent level of safety. The amendments are being imposed on existing runways that are not currently subject to the 150 meters requirement in the fifth edition of the Aerodrome Standards and Recommended Practices (TP 312).</td></tr><tr><td>Registration</td><td colspan=\"5\" id=\"registration\"><strong>Registration: </strong>SOR/ 2021-0269  <strong>Publication Date:</strong> 2022-01-05</td></tr><tr><td>Attachments</td><td colspan=\"5\"><a href=\"attachment.php?attach=41409&amp;lang=en\">Attachment</a></td></tr></tbody></table>",
